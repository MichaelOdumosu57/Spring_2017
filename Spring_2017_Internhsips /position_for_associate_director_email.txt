Good afternoon  IT Director Joel Duran

       My name is Michael Odumosu and I am an incoming Junior(Fall 2017) majoring in Computer Science. I am interested in applying to be an IT Assistant Director for Student Association.

I am currently the co-web developer for ASIS&T Ualbany Chapter. As a part of my role, I set up and developed the website from scratch. I believe I am well-qualified for this role because along with my technical knowledge I am well-versed with working with a team. I desire to be in SA because cooperative and innovating with a team to fulfil goals will help me broaden my horizons.
Even though I am relatively new to the daily operations of SA, I strongly believe that I will be able to work with the Student Association board to fulfil my duties and add to the positive reputation of SA.

â€‹Though I am relatively new to the daily operations of SA, I believe I am well qualified for this job. I understand that although the Student Association Board consists of several members, they are focused on working together to achieve their goals. I consider myself qualified, but I also believe that I will be able to do more than I can every do alone with additional input from many of the Student Association staff. I greatly desire to be part of the SA Information Technology department because it uses cooperation and innovation to achieve its goals and pioneer to new capabilities as a recent addition to the Student Association. Not only will I show myself to be a great team member, I will do my best to complete the job and bring good reputation to the Student Association. My resume is attached to this e-mail.

Thank you and president Jerlisa Fontaine for considering me as associate IT director for the Fall 2017 semester.

Have a good summer break
