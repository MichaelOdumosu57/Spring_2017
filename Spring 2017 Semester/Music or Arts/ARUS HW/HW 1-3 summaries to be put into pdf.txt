they started to show supernatural in not only a historical but modern (for that day) way

pg 13

Khanzhonkov (Khanz) used celluoid (a material for screening films) to make a cool military feature film The Defence of Sevastpool ...
before cimena became a part of normal life, it had to show comedy and drama

cinema went from foreign to domestic
when Protazanov joined Ermoliev, he became a better director

to make ppl feel better compaines turn to melodramas

pg 21
Mirages 1915, about a young woman who read a book of a millonarie and falls in love w/ her son, he drops here and her fiancee and family reject her, she kills her self

pg 22
Yevgeni Bauer is the master of women melodrama
his melodramas were about moral decline and what was going on in the minds of women
Twilight of a Woman Soul (1913) about a women and how she loses her privilege when she gets raped

pg 23-24
these melodrams juxtapose the new woman who looks for independence, to the old one who is seen as an object of beauty to be tossed

pg 25
Silent Witness (1914) bauer juxtaposes urban n rural life in this melodrama ...
he also made short comedies that copied the 1910's style

pg 29
the main star was a lady Kholodnaya who played as Nata
the main star however wasn't a good actress Bauer had to work w/ that
she died of influenza, a controversial death, some said she died because she was being a spy
women in his melodramas also were powerful and wise when ppl were counting on them the most, or male counterparts messed up , but they had to make hard sacrifies

pg 30
after she died Bauer was making the same type of film. The Dying Swan (1916) about a a mute dancer named Giselle who is courted by some man, when she sees him w/ another girl he tells her father to let her dance to make him jealous. the man later explains the confusion n they get married

pg 31
(irrelevant stuff)
his melodramas explore basically how ppl feel, and he puts them in a candyland setting
in early Russian cinema, women were view as objects of contemplation instead of equality
author says women are sensetive n emotional w/ dreams. Men are square couch potatoes who lived by square rules ...

pg 32
melodrama made learning literally about how humans act in situations ,more interesting
after 1917 when tsar fell, revolutionaries came back to Russia n censorship was released
what happened was all the major companies were still around, but gov't stopped doing business w/ them, they kept cinema open cuz they lost equipment w/ them as well. Foreign movies were halted, so they decided to add cinema as a department in the Soviet gov't basically

pg 33
Cinema vists became a luxury as more started to close many directors started to leave Russia also
many artists remained in Moscow and became loyed to the Soviet Union agit-trains ran around country showing Soviet propagands
Lev Kuleshov, an apprentice of Bauer, started making films, he was about manipulating images to tell a story

pg 34

in 1917-1919 melodrama movies ended. Now movies were about getting rid of the church, ending workers union and progress to the future
it was slow because you basically had to do the system

pg 35 -37
movies made during the Soviet Revolution and the October Revolution were evil n demonic such that took place in remote countries as Satan Triumphant by Protazanov - the movie was about the devil coming to play hymns and then seducing women
(irrelevant stuff)
Protazanov was good at being stylistic, while making movies ppl liked. by acting german (germans like demon stuff) he did well abroad
8/27/1919 Soviet film was nationalized, foreign films were out of the picture (smiley face)
Soviets realized how powerful film was
