Questions about sylabus txt

I am confused about the explanations given in part 1 of the course Requirements in the syllabus. I am aware that there are study questions 
paragraphs that we have to write and am I also aware of the study questions that are in class but I do not understand the desired format
of the study questions and specifically the format of the study questions (word-processed, written numbers) how they are supposed to be handed 
(blackboard, e-mail) and how you want each type of reponse in part to done ( I mean the writing format in other words how do you
want the response to be setup)

For part 2 of course requirements what do you mean by identification problems in the midterm

Also I want to confirm that all the requried books excluding the ones held in the library I need to purchase from the bookstore include 
1.	1.	Beumers, Birgit, The Cinema of Russia and the Soviet Union. London: Wallflower, 2007. 
2.	Lovell, Stephen. The Soviet Union: A Very Short Introduction. Oxford – New York: Oxford University Press, 2009. 
3.	Beumers, Birgit. A History of Russian Cinema. Oxford. New York: Berg, 2009. 

and the one we should get online is 2.	Ascher, Abraham. Russia. A Short History. Oxford: OneWorld, 2009.
