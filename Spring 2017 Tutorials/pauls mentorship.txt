make sure you validate every variable before it is received into a function

if a program is not working, get all your cookies, (saved credentials ) if you can and uninstall and reinstall the program

demeter.availabs.org is mapped to an IP address, if its port 80 it will show the index.html webpage if its port 22 it will show the home file explorer

if computer crashes because you are editing a website, fix buggy loops or else it will eat up your memory

to test buggy loops run in in a containers(linux), soo you can crash it if its growing too much, unix called jails,

in chrome os opening crosh and typing in pop you can see how your cpu is being used, and see what exactly crashes your computer. when cpu usage gets high look to the far left to see the program crashing you computer then try to figure it out

when working with javascript functions
Object is an object Object.keys() is a function that returns an array
array.reduce is an array in where if you want to find if a count equals a total use
to pull a dictionary.value you set it equal to reduce(sum, k) like this
var val = object(k)
then

var _sum = Object.keys(types).reduce(function (sum, k) {
  
    var val = types[k]
  
    if (val) {
      sum += val
    }

    return sum
  }, 0)

the zero is the second parameter in the reduce function that initalizes the sum to zero so you can get the proper answer
when coding

a. use a for loop when you can over functional programming
b. use variables then the real nested represetation of yanking properties from an object (object dereferencing)
so you can change the value instead of change all instances of object yanking
c. the simpler you can make your code the better

javascript arrays
put integers, then if you put a decimal its bad, let it know earlier what type will array use
don't go downwards from an array count backwards


tmux
tmux allows you to run seperate sessions if your are ssh through a remote sever, or do not want to open up multiple terminals, or want to close a terminal to save space
to do it you say
tmux
do what you want in the session , say run a database query
to get out of the session [ctrl-b] [:]
in the yellow highlight say detach
to see your windows say tmux ls
