---------------------------- to signfiy code blocks

when telling another computer to make a database request its known as an xmlhttprequest, this is blocked to prevent hacking but to override this :


node-postgres-promises is the express.js app


when change CORS through express.js what you want to do is to find the app.js file in node-postgres-promises, if its not there do npm install

then apply this code in there, var app is the express() app make sure that


in console.log
when you see a number glycophion that means how many times a number appears in  a row

var express = require('express');
var app = express();

then apply this code apppropriately

then npm install cors

then add var cors = require('cors') [check if you need semi-colon later]
then put app.use(cors()) under //view engine setup

then npm restart if necessary

then place this in index.html w/ adjustments
d3.json([database], function(error, absent) {
  if (error) return console.error(absent);

})
