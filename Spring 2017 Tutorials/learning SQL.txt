SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Mexico';

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID=1;

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany'
AND City='Berlin';

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City='Berlin'

'ORDER default is ascending, first takes precedence over the second as in orders first attribute and sub-orders second not redoing the table'



SQL Insert

INSERT INTO table_name
VALUES (value1,value2,value3,...);

'specifes a new row to insert values'




SQL Update

UPDATE table_name
SET [column_name] = [new_column_value], (same thing)...

'changes value indicated by set at row indicated by where for more columns use comma seperator WHERE will update all items with column_value removing the WHERE clause updates all records'


SQL Delete

DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE [some_column]=[some_value] AND (same)...;

use AND to specify what rows you want deleted'
