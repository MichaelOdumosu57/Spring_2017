learning github

git checkout UalbanyASIST/master -- ./members.html
to received an update file that someone is working on

.gitconfig file


to make a copy of the master branch because git push thinks everything is up to date

git checkout temp
git branch temp
push everything until you can figure out how to merge temp back to master


if you need a file from a specific commit
git checkout [commit from git log]
git checkout [file(previous command tells you if file is inside commit)]


pushing to a branch

git push [remote_nickname(aka URL)] [branch]
//but commits and branch need to match up


I believe that git uses linked-list technologies so do not play around with if, or if you do do not use it on anyhting important, and do not take risks, problems might corrupt your account and if you do not know the full extent of what you are doing  see what happens anyway. Although highly suggest to watch a tutorial I was like this when I first started git and look where I am now


to transfer ownership of a repository to an organiztion

go to settings and transfer ownership it should be easy from there



Git branches

git branch
see all curent branches

git branch [name]
make a new branch

git branch -d [branch]
deletes a branch

git branch -D [branch]
force deletes a branch

git branch -m <branch>
rename the current branch

git checkout
    git checkout [existing-branch]

git clone makes a new folder in your directory not the one you want it to be
